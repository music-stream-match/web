# Musica

## What

Musica is a free, open-source web application that lets you transfer playlists between TIDAL, Spotify, Deezer, and Apple Music. Simply log in to your source and target services, pick a playlist, and transfer it — all from your browser, with no server storing your data.

## Why

Switching between music streaming services shouldn't mean losing your carefully curated playlists. Commercial playlist transfer tools are often paid, limited, or require you to hand over your credentials to a third-party server. Musica was built as a free, open-source alternative that runs entirely in your browser — your tokens never leave your device.

## How

1. Enter an invitation code to access the app
2. Select a **source** streaming service and log in via OAuth (or ARL for Deezer)
3. Choose a playlist to transfer
4. Select a **target** streaming service and log in
5. Start the import — tracks are matched across services using a local mapping database and added to a new (or existing) playlist on the target service

All authentication happens directly with the streaming provider. Tokens are stored only in your browser's localStorage and are never sent to any backend.
